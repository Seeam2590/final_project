## About the project
Hi, I am Seeam Shahid Noor and I am very happy that you decided to check this project out. I was born and brought up in Dhaka, Bangladesh and Football (aka soccer) has always been a huge part of my life growing up. People outside my country might not know this but the football fan culture is huge in Bangladesh. So, when given the chance to present a data analysis project for the class Gov 1005 at Harvard I decided to take it to present some basic but interesting stats on the teams of the English Premier League, the most watched sports league in the world. https://www.premierleague.com/  

## Content
The interesting stats presented have been divided into few categories to make them easy to access and understand. The sections can be accessed from the navigation dashboard on the left. The title of the sections are pretty self-explanatory to indicate what the stats will be about. For instance, 'Attack Stats' will show some interesting stats teams had during atacking plays. Finally, I have also decided to add few interesting stats from the Laliga so some of my best friends, who are fans of Barcelona and Real Madrid, doesn't miss out.

## Collaboration
The goal was to make the project something English Premier League Fans from Bangladesh would enjoy exploring. So, at first I took a look at the data available and made a short list of what interesting analysis I could be doing. Then, I reached out to Plaantik , a platform dedicated to football fans of Bangladesh with over 81,500 Facebook followers . Plaantik found the idea of a data analysis project to be interesting and made a public Facebook post asking its followers what type of analysis they would be interested in knowing. The response was overwhelming and it can be found , here . The Facebook post was a good way of gauging specific fan interest in analysis that they'd enjoy and provided a very good idea of where I can start. I remain grateful to Plaantik and to every fan who contributed in idea generation. I tried to add a few fun stats in the 'Fun Facts for Fans' section.

## Description of Data
The Data has been taken from the Kaggle profile of Zaeem Nalla. The creator of the dataset has made the data publicly available and ready for use in personal projects. The data was acquired from the English Premier League Official website. It contains the match results of all football matches in the English Premier League seasons starting from 2006/2007 through 2017/2018.

Additionally, I will also do a mini data analysis on the Laliga (Spanish Football Leageue) as well. The data for that can be found here.

We used three data sets for our analysis: 
1. Results.csv - Results of 4560 Premier League Matches. Dimensions of the data = 4561 X 6  
2. Stats.csv - Basic statistics collected from Opta (official stats collector of the Premier League) of each team in every season (season totals) from 2006/2007 to 2017/2018. Dimensions of the data = 204 X 42  
3. LaLiga_dataset.csv - Results of all matches of laliga from 1970/1971 to 2016/2017 season. Dimensions of the data = 908 X 16
