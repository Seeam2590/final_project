## Milestone
April 5: Rough Github repo, with all necessary data, and reproducible Rmd document. The Rmd must contain two items. First, a brief description of the data, where you got, what you have done with it so far and what you plan to do. Second, a beautiful ggplot2 graphic using some of the data.
